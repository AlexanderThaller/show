# Episode 1 - Hello Universe

This is the very first episode of "Hello Rust!". I'm so excited!

It is my lighthearted journey to become a fearless, more effective Rust programmer. And you can be part, too!
My goal is to address beginner and intermediate Rust questions and show that systems programming can be a lot of fun.
