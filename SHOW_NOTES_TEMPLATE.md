Howdy!

Yes, this is the show we've all been waiting for.
Hello Rust! will pull us out of the morass of undefined behavior into the brave new world of safe systems programming.
It will be our lighthearted journey to become fearless, more effective programmers.

My goal is to address beginner and intermediate Rust programmers and show that systems programming is a lot of fun!
You can also watch the video at 1.5x the speed to boost the learning pace.
