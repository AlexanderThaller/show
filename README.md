### How to support me

**If you have an idea for a future show, [don't hesitate to create a new issue](/issues).**

### Inspiration

These shows inspired me to make this:

* [Ferris Streams Stuff](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mpLlHn0FOekNg05yCnkzQ)
* [Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q)
* [Just for func](https://github.com/campoy/justforfunc)

### List of episodes

* #0: **Humble Beginnings** - An introduction on what this show is about. [[Code](/episodes/0-humble-beginnings)]
* #1: **Hello Universe** - Builder Pattern, Enums, standard traits. [[Video](#)][[Code](/episodes/1-hello-universe)]

### Creating an episode

The following notes are helpful for me when recording a new episode.  
Also, I thought it might be interesting to others, who also consider to run their own show.  

#### Getting started

* Pick an issue from the [issues page](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/issues) or create a new one.
* Move it to *Planning* in the [Show Board](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/projects/3).
* Open the issue and add an agenda for the show.

#### Shooting the video

* Cleanup SD card of digital camera
* Set-up microphone
* Test recording and audio
* Close all unrelated apps
* Hide Bookmarks Toolbar in Firefox (right-click next to address bar and remove tick)
* Prepare IDE settings
  - Set slightly bigger font (VS Code: `editor.fontSize": 15`)
  - Enter "zen mode"
* Set Mac to do not disturb mode
* Get cracking!

### Shooting the intro

* Create a teaser intro that shows exactly what to expect as an outcome (show some code, too).

### Postproduction

* Cut video
* Color Grading
* Add music
* Normalize sound

#### Before publication

* Upload the project (including show notes) to Github.
* Create a nice title image for the video.

#### Publication

* [Hello Rust homepage](https://hello-rust.show)
* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ_EWaQZCZuGGfnuqUoHujw)

#### After publication

* Add show notes to the video description.
* Add time markers to the video description.
* Announce episode on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matthiasendler).
* Announce episode on [/r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/).
* Add a link to the video in the `README`:  
	```
	* #122: **Foo and the magic Bar** - Builder Pattern, Enums, standard traits [[Video](#)][[Code](/episodes/122-foo-and-bar)]
	```
* Charge camera battery for next shoot.

### FAQ

**Q: What development environment are you using?**    
**A:** Right now, I use *VSCode* and the *Rust* plugin plus the *Rust Language Server*.  
I also heard good things about the IntelliJ Rust plugin, though.  
Therefore, I might try this setup in the future.  

**Q: What is your post-processing routine?**    
**A:** Quite simple. I solely use iMovie right now. There are better programs out there, but so far it does the job.

**Q: What is the name of your theme?**  
**A:** Usually I use 1337, but that can vary per show. I will try to mention it in the show notes, if it's something else.

**Q: What font are you using?**  
**A:** Operator Sans Mono
