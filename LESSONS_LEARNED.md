1. Doing a single episode takes me *ages*. I would never have thought it takes so much time.
2. After a video is shot, you can not change the narrative anymore.
   You'll wake up in the morning and think: "oh my God, I totally forgot THAT".
   But the only you can do is add a comment or cut stuff, not add things to the recording.
3. There's a ton of royality free music out there, but it's hard to find because it's not properly categorized or
   the preview is cumbersome. Right now I use [freemusicarchive](freemusicarchive.org/), although it's not the
   most convenient to use.
4. Like everything else, video editing is a rabbit hole. From multicamera setups to LUTs, 
   there's sooo much to learn and experiment with. But it's also a lot of fun!
