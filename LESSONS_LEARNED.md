1. Doing a single episode takes me *ages*. I would never have thought it takes so much time.
2. After a video is shot, you can not change the narrative anymore. You'll wake up in the morning and think: "oh my God, I totally forgot THAT". But the only you can do is add a comment or cut stuff, not add things to the recording.
3. There's a ton of royality free music out there, but it's hard to find because it's not properly categorized or the preview is cumbersome. Right now I use [freemusicarchive](freemusicarchive.org/), although it's not the most convenient to use.
4. Like everything else, video editing is a rabbit hole. From multicamera setups to LUTs, there's sooo much to learn and experiment with. But it's also a lot of fun!
5. Always double check the final rendered video for hick-ups before uploading.
6. Video assets are huuuge. A typical episode takes hundreds of gigabytes of render files. To edit efficiently, I have to squeeze out every byte from my disk.
