### Creating an episode

The following notes are helpful for me when recording a new episode.  
Also, I thought it might be interesting to others, who also consider to run their own show.  

#### Getting started

* Pick an issue from the [issues page](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/issues) or create a new one.
* Move it to *Planning* in the [Show Board](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/projects/3).
* Open the issue and add an agenda for the show.

#### Shooting the video

* Set Mac to "do not disturb mode"
* Prepare IDE settings
  - Set slightly bigger font (VS Code: `editor.fontSize": 25`)
  - Hide sidebar
* Close all unrelated apps
* Cleanup SD card of digital camera
* Set-up microphone
* Test recording and audio
* Get cracking!

#### Before uploading

* Upload the source code to Github.
* Create a nice title image for the video.

#### After publication

* Add links to the video description.
* Add time markers to the video description.
* Announce episode on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matthiasendler).
* Announce episode on [/r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/).
* Add a link to the video to the `README` (in [this](https://github.com/campoy/justforfunc) format).

### FAQ

**Q: What development environment are you using?**    
**A:** Right now, I use *VSCode* and the *Rust* plugin plus the *Rust Langauge Server*.  
I also heard good things about the IntelliJ Rust plugin, though.  
Therefore, I might try this setup in the future.
